## Setup
### Rooting
1. Ensure your phone has an unlocked bootloader and is able to support root. [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/ "LineageOS") is a good place to start for a custom ROM and they have good installation instruction for each device.
2. Install [Magisk](https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-install-magisk/ "Magisk") to root the phone via recovery. Repackage the MagiskManager App and add Pokémon Go to Magisk Hide. Make sure to delete the folder `/sdcard/MagiskManager` after repackaging. It's necessary to pass the Safetynet check to run Pokémon Go on rooted phones. Check the Safetynet status in the MagiskManager App.
